<h1>Maps Tool</h1>
<p>
  Use the Maps Tool to plan locations and regions in a world!
</p>
<p>
  Click the plus button on the left bar to create a new map. The editor visualizes the map as a hex grid.
  In the map's details panel, use edit button in the header bar to rename the map, and use the Note section
  to describe the map. Map notes support the same markdown as the Notes Tool, more details can be found
  <a [routerLink]="['notes', 'help']" [relativeTo]="null">here</a>.
  The configure section adjusts the map, by adding or removing rows and columns and
  by setting a background image for the entire map.
</p>
<p>
  Click anywhere in the grid of the map to select that tile. Each tile supports adding its own notes as well,
  along with the same markdown. However, tiles cannot be linked to from other notes.
</p>
<p>
  Some sample ideas for using this tool:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Prepare for a "hex crawl" by loading a world map as a background image, then fill the notes for the different
    tiles with descriptions of terrain or climate, or with different locations, dungeons, and random encounters
    that may be visited.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan a dungeon encounter by loading a dungeon map as a background image, use the map's notes to describe the dungeon,
    rooms, and random or time-based encounters, and use the tile's notes to describe doors, traps, monsters, treasure,
    or anything else that fills the tile.
  </li>
  <li>
    Utilize the 2D graph for relational or positional note-taking. Your imagination is the limit!
  </li>
</ul>
