<h1>Notes Tool</h1>
<p>
  Use the Notes Tool to write wiki-style notes for anything!
</p>
<p>
  Click the plus button on the left bar to add a new note, and select notes in the list below to swap between a currently viewed note. On a note editor, select the editing button above the note to rename the note, and select the editing button on the note card to toggle between editing and viewing the note.
</p>
<p>
  Notes support adding links to other notes. To link to another note, surround a note's name in square brackets []s. The link will match the first note with the same letters and numbers, regardless of letter case, spaces, or any other symbols in the name. For example, [a-note] would link to a note named "A Note", "Ano Te", "anotE+++", or any similar name.
